**Notebook Template for Northeastern University**

This notebook is a basic template on how to write with good style and easy readability. The first page is a title page, created using HTML code that automatically downloads the logo of the university. Other sections demonstrate how to write headers, link them, and how to plot figures.

Additionally, methods for exporting the `.ipynb` file to PDF and HTML are included. The best method is using the print function in Jupyter Notebooks or exporting to HTML. While exporting to PDF yields a great result, the main issue is missing images. Therefore, for advanced techniques, LaTeX could be adjusted, but it is a quite lengthy procedure, so it will not be covered here.

In case someone is using conda and wants to install pandoc, remember to use the command `conda install pandoc`. This is a common stumbling block for many students.
